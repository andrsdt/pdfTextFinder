# pdfTextFinder


The script is pretty simple, just copy the PDF files that you'd like to analyze in the ```/data```  folder,
run the script and write the string that you'd like to find (without any commas). The script will print the
file and line where it found such input. Consider that, due to PyPDF2's limitations, some PDF files may not
be properly managed.
